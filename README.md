# CNN-for-Classification
📦 1. Import necessary libraries
📚 First, I import all the essential libraries like TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
🖼 I also load image processing tools like ImageDataGenerator from Keras for efficient image handling.

⸻

🖼 2. Upload train and test images and convert them into data
📤 I upload train.zip and test.zip.
📂 Then I unzip the files and organize the images into proper folders by class.
🧮 After that, I use ImageDataGenerator to preprocess the images and load them into generators for training and validation.

⸻

🧠 3. Create model (CNN + ANN + compile)
🧱 I build a CNN model using layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Flatten to extract image features.
🧮 Then I add ANN layers using Dense for classification.
⚙ Finally, I compile the model with:
	•	Optimizer: adam
	•	Loss: categorical_crossentropy
	•	Metric: accuracy

⸻

🧪 4. Optimize hyperparameters with Optuna TPESampler
🎯 I use TPESampler from Optuna to search for the best hyperparameters.
🔁 I define an objective function and let Optuna run multiple trials.
🏆 After training, I select the best parameters based on validation accuracy.

⸻

🧱 5. Use best parameters for CNN + ANN + compile and create final model
✅ Using the best parameters from Optuna, I rebuild the CNN + ANN model.
🧠 I adjust the architecture accordingly.
⚙ Then I re-compile the model using the optimized settings.

⸻

📊 6. Fit data with final model
🏋 I train the final model on the training dataset.
⏳ During training, I monitor the loss and accuracy.
📈 I also save the training history so I can visualize the performance over epochs.

⸻

🔍 7. Use images for deployment and check if model predictions are correct
📷 I load individual images for prediction.
🤖 I use the trained model to predict the class of each image.
🧾 Finally, I display the predictions and verify if they are correct.
